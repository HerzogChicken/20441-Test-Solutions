# 20441-Test-Solutions
Solutions for almost all of the first 2 questions in every past final test in this course (20441 intro to programming and Java) this includes a very descriptive explanation to the solutions, some solutions go beyond the requirements of the course and uses methods learned in other courses (algorithms 20417 and DSA 20407) to solve the questions but don't let that deter you, it is still simple and easy to follow.
Solutions will include the naive brute-force way along with more elegant solutions.
Everything is marked so you can search for a specific question by the year and number of a final test.
